Which if partial delivered records are provided to the received implementation and then forces decryption and integrity verification, then the receiver will have DTLS connection failure also at the end.

The reason for this is that you need to avoid the DTLS layer to drop messages due to non-expected epoch values.

On the receiver side when getting the first first message for the new epoch, the receiver must empty the receive buffer first.\r\nThe point here is that only messages on stream 0 are in sequence...\r\nI think this dance is still needed, but John thinks different.

Even RFC 793 states for MSL: Arbitrarily defined to be 2 minutes.\r\n2. For making sure that no TCP segments from an old TCP connection are in the network anymore, TCP waits twice as long.\r\n3. We need to consider the time time-interval between the DTLS layer at the sending side passes the message to its lower layer and the DTLS layer at the receiving side get the message from its lower layer. When using DTLS/UDP and assuming that the UDP and IP layer do not buffer messages, this time interval can be approximated by the MSL. However when considering DTLS/SCTP, we also need to consider the time a message can be buffered in the SCTP layer. This can not be bound by an MSL.\r\n\r\nTherefore I think we need to do the draining game also used for DTLS 1.0/SCTP. Or am I missing anything?",

This is defined prior to DTLS fragmentation and expansion due to the DTLS record overhead. So this parameter is basically to provide the peer indication of implementation limits in handling certain messages sizes. \r\n\r\nFrom a upper layer protocol perspective this challenge exists in general independently if DTLS is used or not. That is why I am asking if this should be generalized as mechanism so that it could be applied even if this DTLS/SCTP was not used. However, with DTLS in the mix the supported maximum message size becomes a combination of several factors. What the ULP is capable of buffering and processing assuming that the lower layers (DTLS and SCTP) is not the limiting factor. And if DTLS or SCTP or combination if implementation is the limiting factor the limit for that combination. \r\n\r\nSo limitations that could arise without making assumption on implementation are:\r\n\r\n- Buffering in DTLS sender or receiver if the ULP to DTLS API does not support partial message handling. \r\n- SCTP buffering if its API does not support partial message handling\r\n\r\nI hope this makes it clear that I think we have limitations if the implementations all the way are optimal, and even in this case we might want a method for the ULP to express limitations to the peer. \r\n\r\n",
